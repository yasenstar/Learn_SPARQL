## Use "RDF Grapher" to Visualize RDF Data

Here [RDF Grapher](https://www.ldf.fi/service/rdf-grapher) is one nice online tool that can parse RDF data and visualize it as a graph, I'm using this to generate visualized diagram for the data file in the course, and store the exported image in the same data file folder respectively.
